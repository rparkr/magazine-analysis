    "# Text Analysis: 50 yrs. of Magazine Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author:** [Ryan Parker](https://github.com/rparkr)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data source:** Data scraped from magazines of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from 1971-2021. Starting point: [Church Magazines](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/magazines?lang=eng).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: understand trends in topics addressed through the content of four magazines produced by [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://churchofjesuschrist.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to collecting data, I'll analyze the data and implement various machine learning algorithms to understand the data, uncover insights, and make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "1. <strong><span style=\"color:rgb(82, 191, 127)\">Data collection (this notebook)</strong></span>: Gather data through webscraping, lightly process it, and save it to .csv files.\n",
    "2. Topic modeling: assign a topic to each document (article) and label the topics, then append the topic label as a new feature (column) in the dataset.\n",
    "3. Data augmentation: modify and add additional features (columns) to the dataset to enhance its analysis.\n",
    "4. Analysis: explore the dataset through visualization, and make predictions using supervised and unsupervised machine learing algorithms."

    "One way to know the section is to open the _contents_ page of each issue (the main URL of the issue) and scrape links to each article from the `<nav class=\"tableOfContents-HYfFr\">` element on the left of the screen. Each article (`<a>` element) will have an attribute that identifies its connection to the header it falls under. If the element's `style` attribute is `style=\"padding-inline-start:16px\"`, the element is part of the \"general\" section of magazine articles, but if its `style` attribute is `style=\"padding-inline-start:32px\"` (i.e., with `32px` of indentation or more), the element's section is the same as the nearest section header above it (a `<span class=\"sectionTitle-_Dn99 sectionLabel-HdHsm\">` element that is a parent element to the article).\n",
    "> Key takeaway: the level of indentation is the surest way to identify the section that an article belongs to; it's difficult to figure out from the URL alone or from the combination of the URL and the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from re-scraping the data on each article to determine the section based on its level of indentation, there might not be a sure way to accurately determine the correct section (that is, assign the section \"general\" rather than a more specific category when the article belongs to the general magazine articles and not to a specific category).\n",

There are 7 forward slashes in the URL for an article in the \"general\" section (and for many articles that have a specific section as well -- 7 is the minimum number of forward slashes).\n",
    "- THEN reclassify the article as the 'general' section and keep track of what its section was to check if the following sections should be updated.\n",
    "- If the article follows a section that was changed to 'general' and the article's section is the same as the one that was changed to 'general', then change the current article's section to 'general' as well -- since articles don't switch back and forth between the 'general' category and a more specific category (I think -- from the samples I've looked at so far, that seems to hold true).\n",

    "We, the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, solemnly proclaim that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator’s plan for the eternal destiny of His children.\n",
    "\n",
    "All human beings—male and female—are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny. Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the premortal realm, spirit sons and daughters knew and worshipped God as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize their divine destiny as heirs of eternal life. The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first commandment that God gave to Adam and Eve pertained to their potential for parenthood as husband and wife. We declare that God’s commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force. We further declare that God has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife.\n",
    "\n",
    "We declare the means by which mortal life is created to be divinely appointed. We affirm the sanctity of life and of its importance in God’s eternal plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children. “Children are an heritage of the Lord” (Psalm 127:3). Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs, and to teach them to love and serve one another, observe the commandments of God, and be law-abiding citizens wherever they live. Husbands and wives—mothers and fathers—will be held accountable before God for the discharge of these obligations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The family is ordained of God. Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan. Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity. Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities. By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners. Disability, death, or other circumstances may necessitate individual adaptation. Extended families should lend support when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We warn that individuals who violate covenants of chastity, who abuse spouse or offspring, or who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before God. Further, we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call upon responsible citizens and officers of government everywhere to promote those measures designed to maintain and strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society.\n",
